# **Coding Review**


As the sole person responsible for coding book pages 20-23 of _"The Yellow Wallpaper"_, I was overcome by the woeful dread that of author Charlotte Perkins Gilmanâ€™s protagonist felt. Me, forced by a matriarchy to do her bidding (my professor), encountered the spillage of code-jargon that danced like a flame as red lines pillaged the words of a Lady going mad. My hand clicking-on, droning-on with monotony before the _save as_ button opened the door to my escape back into society. 


Honestly, I did not suffer the way that the lead woman in the _Yellow Wallpaper_ did. The process of coding the source material was made easy by my professor who transcribed the scans before this point in the project. My job was to input a transcribed Google document into the [Oxygen](http://alternativeto.net/software/oxygen-xml/?license=opensource) coding service.  


When first interacting with Oxygen, it can be overwhelming, but this was quickly remedied by tools provided by, once again, my professor. She provided ever tag needed including but not limited to underlined, crossed out, or misspelled words. A second tool was her own live interaction that gave me all I needed to be successful.

The tool that was the most helpful was done be me. Before we started to code, we were instructed to use the tags on the Google document. This allowed for a smooth copy and past method that made the process fast and easy. One thing that I jokingly say is "Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, that my whole degree!"

The coding process took only ten minutes once the video aid concluded. In the end, I felt as though I understood my little section more after breaking down all the human error. If you find yourself needing to code a print or scan, here is a site tutorial to help [Oxygen Tutorials](https://oxygenbuilder.com/tutorials/).
