# The Grant Narrative Project # 
I was tasked with completing the process of getting a grant for a Digital Humanities project. Through a four week period, I was responsible for coming up with an abstract for an important Digital Humanities project. Next, there needed to be a page long scan of the environment (research/studies) surrounding the topic I chose. The meat of the process, the Grant Narrative, laid out the inner workings and purpose of the project as well as the budget. The final part of the Grant Narrative Project is my resume, which worked as a final show of credibility to the investors.  

My project is titled, **_Liberal Teen Literature Project_**, and it is intended to find leftist ideologies in young adult literature and make them accessible to children in a fun way. For this project, because it is not intended to be actually done, only covers one novel series and one leftist topic. I chose to highlight the environmental changes in James Patterson’s **_“Maximum Ride”_**. The series was a personal favorite in my youth and it is convenient to extrapolate references from since I own every book, comic, manga, and movie.  

## The Abstract  
  
My proposal is meant to bring about a conversation. I chose to bring up the connection between a group of people who are mentally distant from a humanitarian problem, children and climate change. _“Like the novel, our goal is to expand awareness of the dangers of climate change to young adults. For this novel, we will be developing a progressive map of the world of “Maximum Ride” from start to finish. This will allow us to showcase the disastrous transformation of a planet due to global warming pollutants.” Upon approval by my instructor, I decided to focus only on one series.    

## Environmental Scan  

For this portion, I have to compile a group of at least ten scholarly sources, five being peer-reviewed. With these sources, I had to write a one page preview of what the conversation has been prior to my project. This information is crucial for presenting to the supporters that a conversation is being had. A unique approach/ perspective is what will grab the investors’ attention and best show why they should support my project. For this section, I was involved in two peer-review sessions that allowed me to fine-tune my paper, making it more concise and effective. I had too deep of a description of the history of the novel, which is repeated information.  


## Grant Narrative/ Budget  

This portion is the main pitch for the project. The Environmental Scan focused on the conversation, the Narrative focuses on the makeup and purpose of the project. I expressed my want to build a connection between children and climate-change by building a site dedicated to mapping its prevalence in novels marketed to children. I also detailed how my site would appear, be interactive, support the authors, and induce learning. The Budget fell at the end but detailed the specific cost of every part of the project. My project came out to be under the 1,500 dollar budget given by my instructor. This portion was also peer-reviewed, which greatly helped me focus in on what should be in the Narrative verses the Environmental Scan.      

## The Resume  

For this final section, I was given the option of creating a resume or a CV. Personally, I have never found interest in doing a CV, so, like most of my peers, I commenced with a classic resume. The best part about this process is that it is very practical. For one, if you already had a resume, then this portion is relatively labor free. If you did not have one, then this was an opportunity to build a solid resume with clear guidance from an instructor. Outside of the practicality, it is added to let the investors know what makes me a qualified person to head the project. As a freelancer artist and voiceover actor, I found it hard to express my professional experience without having many solid titles. As an academic, I have no accolades to my full time job, which made me realize that I have to beef up my last three semesters of school.  

## Conclusion  

As a whole, the project is extremely helpful for those who will be competing for any sort of grant or job. I had the opportunity to learn some technical writing, scanned the field my project covered, had more peer to peer critique, and learned how to create a competitive resume.   

### Reflection on the Year  

As a minority student at a Liberal Arts college of, I am exposed to a lot of Liberal propaganda. In my Digital humanities class, it was no different. We surveyed many humanitarian projects, looked at _“The Yellow Wallpaper”_ (a feminist story), and a few articles on systematic injustice. That said, I wish that there was no distinction between leftist and rightwing ideal in humanities. I should not be able to call anything in DH Liberal propaganda.  
Prior to this semester, I had never heard of Digital humanities, so I had no opinion on it. Now, I see it as a possible bridge to helping evolve everyone into a more cohesive unit. Written works are not as cheap, accessible, or generally as entertaining as the interactive, digital aspects of Digital databases and depictions.
