# I am Dallas Austin

I (he/him) am a junior who is taking DH because I am currently on the path to becoming an **Episodic writer**. I have never used social media outside of _YouTube_, which I use as storage for projects or recording _cool moments_ in video games. In 1998, I was born in Utah but have lived in Newport News for most of my life. In 2020, I quit my job of Five years to focus on school Full time, in those five years, I learned that I had an incredible talent for guest service leadership. Over the period, I had dazzled more than three hundred thousand guests at **Busch Gardens Williamsburg** with my array of songs, tricks, jokes, trivia, and most notable, my professional level voiceovers that got me a job offer by Wavy News 10 (which I could not take advantage of).  Juggling high school and college while having a job has made my life verry interesting even without mentioning my old house getting destroyed by lightning while at inside, living in Newport News Park, or my grandmother (whose sister once married Rick James) being the most famous musician in Nigeria many years ago. Most of all, I like juggling, James Patterson’s “_Maximum Ride_”, voice acting, and COD.   

Growing up, my family has had one dog, a stray cat, 27 hamsters (started with two and two-generations latter…), and lots of goldfish. Do not raise 25 hamsters, just give them away when they grow hairs. One hobby of mine is watching good animation and Reck-It Ralph 1&2 are the greatest Pixar release and follow up to date, Glitch has a special place in my heart. Even though I love to entertain, I prefer to be alone when not working and refuse to live on campus in favor of a twenty-minute bike-ride down Jefferson from my home. You will always see me on the “_Road less traveled,_” Robert Frost.   As for my outlook on life, I will leave you all with a quote.  

“_Do not stop at stop-signs and wait for them to turn green_”
