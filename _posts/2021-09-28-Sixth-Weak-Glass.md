# The Editing Process in the Writing Center   
  
### Summary

Ellen Schendel writes about the application of correcting grammar. Rather than contributing to the discussion of balance by weighing the good and bad of correcting mistakes, she offers a quandary about what amount of editing makes a writer better. The rest of the essay just covers her opinion on the apparent hegemony in the writing center and how to challenge it.

The Bibb essay was useful as a case study for how the university values the balance of three elements of writing: grammar, style, and content. She uses the school she teaches at, Salt Lake Community College, and the-U as subjects to see where they place said values. She uses three models to show us what they believe is the best way to balance the three pillars: Equal-overview, Comprehensive-overview, and Element-focused. She finds that both prefer the Comprehensive model where the most valued of the three receives the bulk of the attention. (I was at the-U this summer; it is good to see my hometown of Salt Lake get some love. I would have transferred had I not just least a house 5 minutes away from CNU).

The Peh essay can be summed up as a call to encourage writers by giving them something tangible to work on. She ends the essay by saying that proofreading doesn’t steal from the writer but allows for them to see with “fresh eyes,” meaning, without the hindrance of self-correction.
 
### Comment
I enjoyed the graphs that were in these essays. Most of what we read so far is more subjective or observed than stated. It is good to see these examples because it gives us a model of how our research papers can use quantitative data.   

### Question
If someone is confident in their paper before reaching the writing center, and it turns out to be solid, is it then ok to only work on proofreading. I know a paper can always be better but there must be well polished pieces that only require proofing. I feel like this was the case when I was editing high school and college papers for foreign born exchange students, but I wasn’t as critical of content at the time.
