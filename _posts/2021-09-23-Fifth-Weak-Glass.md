### Summary  
This week our readings focused on the process within a tutoring session. Chapter 2 of BGWT, we learned how to conduct a full session with our clients face-to-face or in an asynchronous format. The chapter goes over the advantages and disadvantages of each while simultaneously chronologizing every step a tutor should take throughout a session to provide an effective service.   

Chapter 3 primarily focused on the writing process and how a tutor can best aid a client within the process. This chapter also establishes that the writing method is not as black and white as other scholarships would have us believe, knowing this will help our understanding of how personal writing is. We also are introduced to the fact that we can offer revision that includes typographical proofreading, but unlike the stigmatized tutor role, it is done after the conceptualization of the paper.    

The Bruffee Essay tries stresses the importance of the connection between peers (ex: the student-tutor and the student). This idea is then linked with how discourse is conducted on a humanities level. The environment, attitude, and motivation all play a key role in effective conversation between peers engaged in a tutoring session.
  
 
### Comment
While I’m not a fan of the Bruffee essay’s format, it was a decent read. There is a lot of things to which I can attest to being effective when teaching or tutoring people around my age. _“The person who does most of the ‘discussing’ in most discussion classes is usually the teacher”_ (Burffee, 94). I always made sure to get to know about the individuals background or motivations with the purpose of balancing out the back and forth as to not seem like a teacher but a peer. It is sad knowing that because I was such a cool boss, people would quit shortly after I moved locations. These methods are effective and should be thought well before entering the workforce or college.   

As a side note, I used code-meshing in one of my comm essays last week and got some really positive feedback form the professor on the uniqness of my approach. I can say that this class is undoughtably relevent and usefull.

### Question
How early do you think “conversation” should be taught in school or when did you first notice that people could not carry real conversation?
