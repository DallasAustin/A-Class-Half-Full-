# Loading...Dallas' Writing

### My Michanics
 In Elementary school, I received my only "B" grade in English as a fifth grader. My flawless report card was sullied because of one subset of the subject; the spelling test. Spelling remains one of my biggest faults in the subject and has resulted in my full support of the **spellcheck** feature.   

While spelling trouble has nearly faded into obscurity with the onset of electronic writing, misusing words has increasingly become a problem in the editorial phase. I find that spellcheck does not help me decide _weather or not to have appeal pie for desert or knot._ Mistakes like those are common in my writing. I tend to lack in the editorial phase no matter how many times I reread my work.  

My most prolific shortcoming has to be my Derridean take on the English language. While I feel that I have no lacking in my use of words or phrasing, I tend to do it in a way that is frustrating to read. I am not the easiest read, so peer reviews end up failing due to my excessive use of elevated philosophical concentrations. When I move out of my style, I drift more toward parodying someone else.   

### What I Write
My favorite type of writing is in a form I call **rantings**. For rantings, I use the persona _J. T. Ranting_ to create a free-flowing argument that is purely in attack mode. While the structure is still in a Rogerian format, it relies heavily on comically ripping into a subject from ridiculous angles. For example: constructing a Derridean deconstructing of Eric Carle's, _"The Very Hungry Caterpillar"_ for a major essay; which I did; just because I can; and got an A. (The peer reviewers could not understand a single paragraph.) I have provided examples of the purest representation of my Derridean writing style below.     

### Samples of My Work

**Samples From _The Deconstruction of a Glutton: An Analysis of The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle_**
"...The solitude of light, moon, a, egg, and leaf depict a scene devoid of dependence on parody. No plurality should signify oneness. Sotoudehâ€™s development of a depressive singularity is only valid when directed at the departmentalization of nature. If one defects to the idea of oneness as a derivative for the world being one, then oneness is not clearly demonstrable but dematerializes."

"...When a child interacts with the foods, the signifier for caterpillar would have to disseminate to the finger but also detach itself from the picture of the caterpillar. If a child refuses to envision their finger as the same caterpillar, are they misunderstanding the signifier? No, they are acting on the idea that the food signifier is two-dimensional, and the caterpillar signifier is three-dimensional, yet the two-dimensional Lepidoptera is not a part of a three-dimensional perspective but the signified is part of the three-dimensional world. The hungry caterpillar is now both the signified and the signifier which entails that the caterpillar is both real and a representation of reality."   

**My Nonfiction Work** I am not a naturally creative person, so even my poetry is rigid and calculated. I follow strict structure and use less playful language than I would typicaly enjoy reading in expression-based works. Here are some examples of my published work that barely made the cut as _expressive_. (CNU **Currents 2021**)

### What I am Improving On
As I have previously stated, I tend to erect quite convoluted concepts in my writing, which is a problem in terms of audience. When my peer reviews are unreadable, it defeats the purpose of the task. That said, I have been making strides in broadening my Platonic diction. I am also working on my proof reading which is severely under a collegiate level. To do so, I am incorporating tools available such as _the Hemmingway App,_ and _read aloud features_ to close in on an audience appropriate structure.
