##### Information and imiges from: _Bedford Guide for Writing Tutors 6th edition Chapters 1,6,8_
  

### Summary  
Although we try to refrain from a _business model of learning_ in the writing center, it is still a service and must exude a level of presentation and conduct. It is crucial that a consultant be knowledgeable in the programs the center offers as well as the subject of writing. If a student is in need of further understanding of a subject brought up during a session, it is imperative that the consultant be wary of not only how to find the information but is able to aid the student in being able to find it for themselves. The center has both asynchronous as well as in-person consultations; understanding the advantages and disadvantages will help aid any participants in creating the most productive and comfortable way of conducting a session.      
 
### Comment
This week’s readings were focused on guiding the counselor on conduct as a staff member in a writing center as opposed to the overall concept of a writing center. This insight gives us an opportunity to see the guess service part of the job that isn’t all about hegemony. I Found that a lot of the tips and guidance was reminiscent of my job as a lead supervisor at Busch Gardens. I have trained hundreds of people to do much more than the writing center counselor is expected to, but this is not an amusement park, these are people's voices. The steps may be the same, but the technique is different because of the more interpersonal focus.  


### Question
When it comes to research only found in another country, how much weight does it carry if the person using that information shares their identity? If a student from _India_ practices organic medicine and wants to share their experiences with it in an academic paper, they would be remiss not to provide published references or studies. If those studies or practices are not supported by US dogma, how should those foreign sources be received to not invalidate the person’s heritage?
