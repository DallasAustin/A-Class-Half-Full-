#### **_Charles Booth’s London: Poverty Maps and Police Notebooks_** project is a **digital archive** based on an inquiry done by Charles Booth in the late 1800’s. The site has a collection of notebooks and [maps](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/map/14/-0.1174/51.5064/100/0) that show the wealth distribution in turn-of-the-century London. With each document are photos and descriptions of Booth's contributions to the works. [Who was Charles Booth?](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/learn-more/who-was-charles-booth).

## The Maps  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The site's biggest draw is the [poverty map](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/map/14/-0.1174/51.5064/100/0) consisting of twelve works compiled and digitized into one.  The map is accessible from any page because its tab is always located in the upper and lower taskbars. This feature overlays Google Maps; the sections overlap the original cartography. Navigation of the locations, lines, and colors, is easy because the developers scaled each image before rendering them. The purpose of the map is to get an understanding of the differentiating economic levels at the time. A key describes the otherwise meaningless colors on the map. With the colors, we can see where the poor, middle-class, and upper-class persons resided.

## The Notebooks 


 From the cover page, the site tells us that there are over **450** original notebooks and **41** _digitized notebooks_. Unfortunately, the site does not provide this many books; there are many non-digitized notebooks that are off online. Available books are not easy to find unless you know what you want to see or by using the  [Highlights](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/highlights) tab. You must do a keyword search where you are giving a good deal of accuracy options but no  topic suggestions. When you do a search, it provides decent results if you are within the ballpark. Thankfully, there is a filter for digitized for the 41 notebooks available.

The notebooks are handwritten with a font close to cursive, some more legible than others but still somewhat difficult to read. The lengths of the books can be upwards of 250 pages and provide first person accounts from the streets of London. I searched for  I searched for  _Prostitution_ (A suggestion from the [Highlights](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/highlights) tab) and got an officer's recording of an arrest including prostitutes. A second book was a report from a low-income store worker witnessing prostitutes work. First person accounts are upwards of 250 pages all handwritten in cursive, some are illegible. The notebooks are displayed with a built-in PDF viewer that allows for zoom and page flips. Navigating the notebooks can be more tedious than the map but provides a much deeper look at civil life.

## User Interface    
	
  The interface is clean and colorful. Vintage pictures on most pages provide context to stories as well as the tabs themselves. Maps and notebooks are accessible from any page on the top taskbar. The map is searchable, meaning that you can use the Google maps search box to find spots mentioned in the notebooks, for example. Interactions with the map are smooth and fun to navigate while admiring the antique cartography. For all books not provided, there is a link in the [About](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/about) section (also accessible when clicking on non-digital books) to _The London School of Economics and Political Science_ (LSE) website. Here, you can find out how you can visit the school and read the offline works in person, once the pandemic lessens. Lastly, the [Highlights](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/highlights) tab helps you discover the big topics people will be most interested in. Topics such as: Drink and drugs, Migrant communities, and Prostitution.     




## The Making of the Project   
	
  Unlike many of the other projects you may encounter, the makers of this particular one did not provide much information about the technology used to make it or have made it difficult to find. What is noted are the open projects that provided some services or resources: [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [The Universal Viewer](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer), [IIIF](https://iiif.io/):used for picture formatting, [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), OS Names API (Not available). 
	
  The original sources are located at the LSE in an archive in Booth’s name titled _Inquiry into the Life and Labour of the People in London (1886-1903)_.  


## Final Thoughts 
	
  The project provides a deep look into English lives at a very personal level while being informative to historians and economists alike. I wish that there were more available works as far as notebooks go, even though they are somewhat hard to read due to handwriting issues. Aside from that, the immaculacy and sharpness of the images, writings, and map are great to look at and navigate.
Students studying the relationship between economics and crime-rate should find this project useful.
