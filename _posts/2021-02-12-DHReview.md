#### The _Charles Booth’s London_ Project is an interactive platform for the original, more ambitious, inquiry done by Booth in the late 1800’s. The site provides a look into a digitized collection of timely notebooks and **maps**(the primary feature) that detail the levels of poverty in near turn of the century London. Alongside the notebooks and maps, there are photos and a detailed description of the Charles Booth and his efforts to create the poverty map as well as his life’s work (_Who was Charles Booth?_ https://booth.lse.ac.uk/learn-more/who-was-charles-booth ).

## The Maps


The biggest draw is the **interactive poverty map** that was originally twelve distinct works until compiled and digitized into one seamless entity. Accessing this map or the individual ones can be done easily from the homepage or from any other stage of your search through the sight because the tab is always located in the upper and lower taskbars. The interactive map is neatly integrated with Google maps, the sections perfectly overlap the indicated areas. With this map, the user can zoom in and out with ease and the visibility of the locations, lines, and colors is exceptional due to the sharpness from the developers properly scaling the images prior to rendering them. The purpose of the map is to get an understanding of the differentiating economic levels at the time. A key legend and description of the legend explain the otherwise meaningless colors on the beige map. With the colors, we can make instantly see where the poor, middle-class, and upper-class persons resided. ![Poverty Map](https://github.com/DallasAustin/The-Dallas-Chronicles-/blob/main/images/Poverty%20Map.jpg)   




## The Notebooks 


Navigating the notebooks is more tedious than the map but provide a much deeper look into the lives of the people of Booth’s London. From the cover page, the site tells us that there are _over **450** original notebooks_ and _**41** digitized notebooks_, which is unfortunately an ambiguous and confusing distinction. Although the site does provide this number of books, they are not easy to find unless you know what you want to see or are given a suggestion in the **Highlights** tab. You must do a keyword search where you are giving a good deal of accuracy options but not any actual topic suggestions. When you do a search, it provides good results if you are in the ballpark but again, there are many non-digitized notebooks, this means that you cannot view most of the works online. Thankfully, there is a search option for digitized only, so there are only **41** notebooks available.

The notebooks are handwritten with a font close to cursive, some more legible than others but still somewhat difficult to read. The lengths of the books can be upwards of 250 pages and provide first person accounts from the streets of London. I searched for _Prostitution_ (A suggestion from the **Highlights** tab) one such book was from an officer recording his arrest including prostitutes, while another was by a low-income store worker witnessing prostitutes work even after prior arrest. The notebooks are displayed with a built-in PDF viewer that allows for zoom and page flips. These stories seem far more capable of bringing the late 1800’s economy of an English city than the poverty map and should be the main draw.

## User Interface    
	
  The interface is clean and colorful. There are vintage pictures on most pages which provide context to stories as well as the tabs themselves. Maps and notebooks are accessible from any page on the top taskbar. The map is searchable, meaning that you can use the Google maps search box to find spots mentioned in the notebooks for example. The interaction with the map is as smooth and can be fun to navigate while admiring the antique cartography. For all books not provided, there is a link in the **About** section (also accessible when clicking on nondigital books) to _The London School of Economics and Political Science_ (LSE) website where you are told how you can visit the school to read the actual works in person, once the pandemic lessens. Lastly, the **Highlights** tab help you discover the big topics people will be most interested in, topics such as: Drink and drugs, Migrant communities, and Prostitution.     




## The Making of the Project   
	
  Unlike many of the other projects you may encounter, the makers of this particular one did not provide much information about the technology used to make it or have made it difficult to find. What is noted are the open projects that provided some services or resources: **Elasticsearch, The Universal Viewer**(GitHub), **IIIF** (used for picture formatting), **OpenStreetMap, OS Names API** (Not available). 
	
  The original sources are a located at the LSE in an archive in Booth’s name titled _Inquiry into the Life and Labour of the People in London (1886-1903).  




## Final Thoughts 
	
  The project provides a deep look into earlier lives at a very personal while being extremely informative to historians and economist alike. I wish that there were more available works as far as notebooks go, even though they are somewhat hard to read due to handwriting issues. Aside from that, the immaculacy and sharpness of the images, writings, and map are great to look at and navigate.
