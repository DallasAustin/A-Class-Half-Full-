**Map of London Project Overview**    
  
If you visited my first project review, you would find a project featuring early London cartography. Well, this project is not too different in subject matter. The _Map of Early Modern London_ digital humanities project or ***MoEML***, is an archive of written depictions of 1500-1600’s London. Along with the written works, is an interactive map from a birds-eye-view of the city. The project provides the user with a political and religious depiction of late the renaissance. 

When first accessing the project, there are sixteen different portals you can click on. While this may seem like a lot, the four main features: the map, encyclopedia, library, and stow, are in the taskbar and again as an icon. If you are new to the site, I recommend clicking on one of the four icons to get started.

In the written part of the archives that are accessible from any of the four main tabs, there are hundreds of portals with short description of each building on the map. The impressive amount of documentation fall under many group distinctions. A specific church could fall under: political district, church, religious subdivision, or a specific name. Clicking on the buildings cause a popup that provides the history.

However, the biggest problem I found while perusing the site was its lack of published works. There are links present that have a watermark stating, _unpublished drafts_. That means that many of the papers are not credible. The absence defeats the purpose of accessing them for research.  

### The Map

The [Map](https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/agas.htm) is my favorite part of the site. Unlike the Booth’s project, this map is largely interactive. As noted on the map tab, the scholastic version allows drawing, zoom, and reangling for the user’s convenience. On mobile devices, the free-draw feature is unusable, the shape inputs are available but slow. I hinted toward the click-ability of every building, but all the roads and landmarks are interactive as well.    
  
While zoomed into the map, there is a screen in screen mini map that is useful for seeing the peripherals. This is a great addition to the map because the districts are large and often run off screen. Knowing which directions to scroll is a helpful benefit of the mini map.     
  
Taking in the map as a whole can be daunting because it is large, black and white, as well as hand drawn. Pressing the map key on the top right of the screen provides some suggestions that highlight various interests on the map. The key has options like, “water features” which you can select a checkbox beside it to have it mark all water features. Next to the checkbox is an arrow that provides zoom, specific names, and an article on the selection. Again, there is so much that you can do, your screen gets flooded by popups and markings. The overstimulation would be a bigger problem if the information were not as useful as it is.  
  
If you need help using any of the tools, there is a [Tools](https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/tools.htm) tab with helpful tips on how to use the map, citing, or making the project into a teaching aid.

### Conclusion
  
As a whole, the MoEML project is very ambitious. Knowing that the project is in development, there is a lot of room for fine tuning and accessibility. Other than there being too much going on, the map is beautiful, and the interactions are clean and particular to the point of satisfaction. For students studying early industrial life, the project provides an immersive experience. For teachers, there are many interactive aspects that can make for comparable lessons.   

Now, the project does not have any holly intentions for humanity. It does, however, fulfill its role as an informational piece of history. Visitors have an opportunity to understand what environmental factors inspired renaissance era works. There is also interest in how political and religious presence physically imposed on English people who would eventually form a more secular and democratic nation.        

### Additional Project information    

The project was made using the scans of a 1633 map and is currently being completely redrawn while still in use. The map has ben rendered using OpenStreetMaps/ OpnLayers by programmer Martin Holmes. The pages are built using static XHTML pages which is in version 6.5 as of 2020. The Original map was developed by observer Ralph Agas in 1561 as a political tool and reference guide.
