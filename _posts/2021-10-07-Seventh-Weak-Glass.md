# Who Are You?   

## Who visits the Writing Center and why should we care?

_Oxford Guide and Bedford Guide_    


### Summary  
This week, we took a look at two guides for the importance of how and who we communicate with in the writing center. The Oxford guide chapters highlighted the key reasons why knowing how to communicate with individuals is critical to reaching the goal of the writer. There is a stress on the quality of discourse based on the tutors ability to understand or attempt to understand the inner workings of the writer's intentions. The guides both make clear the different types of way to communicate with a client, be it verbally, nonverbally, synchronous or asynchronous. If a tutor is proactive in reading the works as well as the person, they can get a better understanding of how to best help the writer. 
  
The second part of the readings targetted how to approach tutoring mechanics. Part of individualism is a person's linguistic background. As we have covered in earlier readings, the OG gives us tips on how to spot the difference between grammatical errors and dialectical differences. While there is no exact science, paying attention to the client and engaging in conversation about them, can help you in understanding what is being sadi and how to move forward with the concerns. The metaphor "scapulting" refers to the process of writing by OG; the tutor addresses the global issues (structure/ concepts) before applying the cosmetics, once applied, then you can edit out the unnecessary scapulting left over. 


### Comment
I feel that the Oxford Guide mirrors a lot of what the Bedford guide professes. The use of both, while somewhat redundant, serves as confirmation that the methods employed by the authors are credible.    

### Question
What is the least compliant client you have ever had (or anyone in a center you have worked in)? What methods did you employ, and was it effective? Did the client use the service again?
