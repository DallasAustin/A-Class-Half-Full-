_ Bedford Guide Chapter 7_    


### Summary  
Chapter 7 was a lesson on how to approach different types of writers. The previous chapter askes, “who do we encounter in a writing center?” while this one addresses their writing types. With the list of general types of writers, the guide gives us a list of does and don’ts when conducting a session. The overall goal is to approach every session uniquely to get the best out of the client and most efficient use of time in a session.

### Comment
There is a concern with the different types, I feel that sections like this on categorize people in a way that seems semi-contradictory to the tabula rasa mindset. That said, there are many similarities in the way people think, so it is completely reasonable to have archetypes and ways to approach them.  

### Question
How would someone approach a tutoring session if they know that there is no student who can understand the complexity of the style? What other options are available at CNU if a student is not satisfied?
